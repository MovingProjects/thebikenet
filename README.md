**theBIKEnet** is a public research project that explores, visualizes, and analyses **urban cycling and micromobility behaviour**,  
integrating survey data, GPS traces, and spatial indicators into a unified environment  
for studying **safety**, **accessibility**, and **cycling culture** in cities.

---

## 🧭 Overview

**theBIKEnet** investigates how people **move, perceive, and experience cycling** in urban areas.  
It combines data from:

- 🚲 **GPS tracking apps** for cycling trips  
- 📋 **Web-based questionnaires** on perceptions and habits  
- 🗺️ **Spatial context data** (infrastructure, environment, risk factors)  

The system connects individual experience with **urban data and transport analysis tools**,  
helping researchers and decision-makers design safer and more inclusive mobility networks.

## 📊 Research Modules

| Module | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| **Profile** | Demographic profile and cycling ability. |
| **Context** | Built environment, infrastructure, and exposure conditions. |
| **Safety Behaviour** | Individual practices, attention, and protective behaviour. |
| **Safety Perception** | Perceived safety and comfort across trip scenarios. |
| **Accidents & Risk Factors** | Self-reported incidents and risk perception. |
| **Mobility Services** | Shared mobility and integration with public transport. |
| **Beliefs & Attitudes** | Cognitive and affective factors shaping cycling choices. |
| **Trip Diary (pre/post)** | Actual mobility experiences and changes over time. |

Each module is published and versioned in the
