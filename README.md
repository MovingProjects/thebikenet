**theBIKEnet** is a public research project developed within the **PlanEasy WebGIS Framework**,  
an open scientific infrastructure for land-use and transport planning.  
It explores, visualizes, and analyses **urban cycling and micromobility behaviour**,  
integrating survey data, GPS traces, and spatial indicators into a unified environment  
for studying safety, accessibility, and cycling culture in cities.

---

## 🧭 Overview

**theBIKEnet** investigates how people **move, perceive, and experience cycling** in urban areas.  
It combines data from:

- 🚲 **GPS tracking apps** for cycling trips  
- 📋 **Web-based questionnaires** on perceptions and habits  
- 🗺️ **Spatial context data** (infrastructure, environment, risk factors)  

The system connects individual experience with **urban data and transport analysis tools**,  
helping researchers and decision-makers design safer and more inclusive mobility networks.
