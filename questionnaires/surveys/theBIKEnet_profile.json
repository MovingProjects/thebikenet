Il nostro obiettivo è rendere la mobilità urbana più sicura, equa e sostenibile per tutte le persone.<br><br>Questo primo questionario ci aiuta a capire <b>chi partecipa al progetto</b> e quanto siano diverse le esperienze di mobilità. Si concentra sul <b>tuo profilo</b>, sulla <b>mobilità quotidiana</b> e su <b>quanto ti senti a tuo agio</b> quando vai in bicicletta o usi un monopattino elettrico. Le tue risposte ci aiuteranno a interpretare i modelli di spostamento e le percezioni raccolte in seguito tramite l’app e altri questionari.<br><br>La partecipazione è completamente volontaria e anonima. Le informazioni fornite saranno utilizzate esclusivamente a fini scientifici ed educativi.<br><br><a href='https://movprojects.com/thebikenet' target='_blank'>Scopri di più sul progetto theBIKEnet</a>",
