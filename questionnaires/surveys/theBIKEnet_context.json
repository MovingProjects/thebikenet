Understanding these daily conditions helps us identify <b>barriers</b>, <b>needs</b>, and <b>opportunities</b> for cycling and micromobility in different parts of the city.<br><br>Participation is completely voluntary and anonymous.

Il nostro obiettivo è rendere la mobilità urbana più sicura, equa e sostenibile per tutte le persone.<br><br>Questo secondo questionario si concentra sul <b>tuo contesto abitativo e di spostamento</b>: dove ti muovi abitualmente, a quali veicoli hai accesso e quanto è facile parcheggiarli o custodirli. Comprendere queste condizioni quotidiane ci aiuta a individuare <b>barriere</b>, <b>bisogni</b> e <b>opportunità</b> per la mobilità ciclistica e la micromobilità in diverse aree della città.<br><br>La partecipazione è completamente volontaria e anonima.
