Our goal is to make urban mobility safer, fairer, and more sustainable for everyone.<br><br>This fourth questionnaire explores <b>how you protect yourself and behave in traffic</b>, including your <b>confidence, safety practices, and reactions</b> to different road situations. Understanding these everyday strategies helps us identify <b>habits and needs</b> that can guide safer riding behaviours and better infrastructure design.<br><br>Participation is completely voluntary and anonymous.
